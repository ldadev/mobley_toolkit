# Windows Support Diagnostic

Use the bundled toolkit to diagnose Windows 10 workstations without silently
changing system configuration.

The toolkit is intended to behave like a professional support tool: robust,
non-destructive, evidential, and safe by default. It collects forensic-quality
support artifacts, identifies indicators requiring review, and supports a low-risk
cleanup workflow for temporary files and browser cache without touching user
personal documents or download folders.

## Bundled files

- `scripts/Auditar-Trafico.ps1`: diagnostic and reporting engine.
- `scripts/Ejecutar-Soporte.cmd`: elevated interactive launcher with a styled
  menu (icons, confirm prompts, colored status markers, update, disk
  optimization, and official license-status actions).
- `scripts/Ejecutar-Soporte-GitHub.ps1`: GitHub downloader and launcher.
- `office/`: Office Deployment Tool and 64-bit Spanish installation configuration.
- `Comandos_Paso_a_Paso_Reparacion_Arranque_UEFI.pdf`: step-by-step Windows UEFI boot repair guide.
- `scripts/launcher.c`: C source for `Soporte-PC.exe`, a native Windows binary
  that runs the GitHub bootstrap command without opening PowerShell manually.
- `Soporte-PC.exe`: compiled double-clickable launcher (repo root).
- `references/github.txt`: current GitHub links and direct execution command.
- `references/USAGE.md`: operating and deployment guide.

Keep the PowerShell script and CMD launcher in the same directory.

## Publication workflow

Any change to `scripts/Auditar-Trafico.ps1` must be published to GitHub after
validation. Review the diff, run the available syntax or behavior checks, then
create a descriptive commit and push it to `origin/main`. Confirm that the
working tree is clean and that the local `main` branch matches `origin/main`
before reporting the change as complete. Do not leave changes to this script
only in the local workspace.

Recompile `Soporte-PC.exe` after changing `launcher.c`:

```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -O2 scripts/launcher.c -o Soporte-PC.exe
```

## Modes

Select the mode that matches the request:

- `Rapido`: five-minute sampling plus essential support checks.
- `Completo`: extended security, hardware, SMART, update, certificate,
  reliability, software, driver, printer, domain, and network checks.
- `Red`: timed traffic, DNS, gateway, adapter, process, and Fortinet-oriented
  evidence collection.
- `Limpieza`: safe, professional cleanup mode with temporary files, Chrome
  cache folders, DNS cache, and Recycle Bin cleanup, while preserving user
  documents, downloads, and recent files. No timed network audit is run.

Run directly when needed:

```powershell
.\Auditar-Trafico.ps1 -Modo Rapido
.\Auditar-Trafico.ps1 -Modo Red -DuracionMinutos 60
.\Auditar-Trafico.ps1 -Modo Completo -IncluirVerificacionSistema
.\Auditar-Trafico.ps1 -Modo Limpieza -DiasTemporalAntiguo 30
.\Auditar-Trafico.ps1 -Modo Red -AuditoriaAnterior 'C:\AuditoriaRed\Auditoria-PC-20260827-120000'
```

Prefer `Ejecutar-Soporte.cmd` (or `Soporte-PC.exe` for end users without
PowerShell familiarity) because it requests elevation, shows a menu with a
print-queue option, preserves errors, and keeps the console open.

Extra switches available on `Auditar-Trafico.ps1`:

- `-LimpiarColaImpresion`: standalone action. Stops the Spooler service,
  deletes stuck spool files, restarts the service, writes a short report,
  and returns immediately without running the rest of the diagnostic.
- `-OptimizarSistema`: standalone action. Empties the Recycle Bin, clears
  the DNS client cache, clears Explorer thumbnail/icon cache files, runs
  `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup`, writes a short
  report, and returns immediately without running the rest of the
  diagnostic. Low-risk, performance-oriented maintenance only.
- `-ActualizarWindows`: installs the official `PSWindowsUpdate` module when
  needed, then searches, downloads, and installs Microsoft updates with
  `Get-WindowsUpdate -MicrosoftUpdate -Install -AutoReboot`. The process may
  restart the computer automatically when required.
- `-DesfragmentarDiscos`: runs `Optimize-Volume -Defrag` on detected fixed
  drives and writes the result to the report. Windows chooses the appropriate
  optimization method for each drive.
- `-MostrarLicencias`: reports Windows and Microsoft licensing information and
  opens the official Windows Activation settings page. It does not execute
  activators or scripts downloaded from the Internet; third-party licenses
  must be verified with their respective vendors.
- `-Modo Limpieza`: the professional cleanup workflow for the end user. It
  targets temporary directories, old Chrome cache subfolders, the DNS cache,
  and the Recycle Bin, while intentionally preserving the user profile,
  documents, and downloads. It detects broken shortcuts in Desktop and Start
  Menu locations and asks before removing only the shortcuts whose file target
  is missing. It does not automatically delete registry keys. It then exports
  a summary and HTML report.
- Menu option `12`, `Rendimiento de Windows`: runs the quick diagnostic and
  reports startup entries, high-memory processes, free storage, published disk
  health, last boot time, and active power plan. It is read-only, stores its
  report persistently under `C:\AuditoriaRed`, and recommendations do not
  disable startup entries or services or change the power plan.
- Menu option `13`, `Reparación de arranque`: opens the bundled UEFI repair
  guide only for systems that pass POST but cannot load Windows. It offers
  symptom triage for no power, POST failure, Windows boot failure, and no video,
  opens official Dell/HP guidance, and can save a local case note under
  `C:\AuditoriaRed\CasosArranque`. Do not collect serial numbers. LED/beep
  codes are model-specific; never diagnose a failed CPU from a generic pattern.
- `-AutoEliminarAlCerrar`: writes evidence to `%TEMP%` instead of
  `C:\AuditoriaRed`, opens the HTML report automatically, and deletes the
  temporary evidence folder only after the user presses a key to exit.
- `-NoAutoAbrirReporte`: skip auto-opening the HTML report.
- `-AuditoriaAnterior`: optional path to a previous audit folder. The report
  compares processes, listening ports, services, and configured DNS servers,
  and writes `comparacion-auditoria-anterior.csv`.

Every completed audit also creates a ZIP package beside its evidence folder.
The package contains the HTML report, CSV files, logs, and SHA-256 manifest.
When `-AutoEliminarAlCerrar` is used, the evidence folder is removed after
exit but the ZIP remains available in the output directory.

Each run also writes `ejecucion.log` with start time, active stages, selected
baseline, errors, and package status. When no `-AuditoriaAnterior` is supplied
for a persistent output directory, the most recent previous audit is selected
automatically. The menu option 10 allows the technician to choose a specific
previous audit manually.

## Required behavior

1. Require Windows PowerShell 5.1 and administrator privileges.
2. Show stage messages and a live percentage progress bar during long
   sampling operations; allow the user to press `Q`/`Esc` to stop sampling
   early and still generate a report from the partial data.
3. Write evidence under `C:\AuditoriaRed\Auditoria-EQUIPO-FECHA` by default,
   or under `%TEMP%` when `-AutoEliminarAlCerrar` is used.
4. Generate `informe-de-soporte.html` and `hashes-sha256.csv`, and open the
   HTML report automatically unless `-NoAutoAbrirReporte` is set.
5. Treat automatic findings as indicators requiring review, not proof of
   malware.
6. Correlate network findings with FortiGate/FortiNAC logs by timestamp, IP,
   MAC, destination, port, protocol, rule, and security event.
7. State that Windows cannot determine licensing for every third-party product.
8. Capture only packet headers by default to reduce exposure of personal data.
9. Diagnose network printers (TCP/IP, WSD, SMB shares): resolve the host/IP,
   ping it, and probe the print port (9100) or SMB port (445) for
   reachability; report inconclusive results as `Revisar`.
10. Offer a dedicated print-queue recovery action that stops the Spooler
    service, clears stuck `.SPL`/`.SHD` files, and restarts the service.
11. Offer a dedicated low-risk optimization action (Recycle Bin, DNS cache,
    Explorer thumbnail/icon cache, DISM component cleanup) that never
    touches user documents, downloads, or installed applications.
12. Include an executive summary and pedagogical interpretation of every
  result block: event logs, processes, services, TCP/UDP, IP, MAC, DNS, ARP,
  firewall, performance, storage, printers, updates, licensing, and errors.
13. Preserve structured evidence for process paths, signatures, users and
  command lines when available; export UDP endpoints, configured IP/DNS/ARP,
  enabled firewall rules, complete services, and security/PowerShell/Defender
  events in addition to the human-readable HTML report.

## Cleanup safety

Never delete downloads, documents, user profiles, arbitrary directories, or
files newer than `DiasTemporalAntiguo`.

The cleanup implementation must:

- Enumerate specific known temporary directories.
- Target Chrome cache folders by profile and cache subdirectory, not the whole
  browser profile.
- Delete files individually by literal path.
- Reject paths outside the resolved temporary root.
- Skip reparse points and never recursively remove a directory.
- Count locked or inaccessible files as failures.
- Produce before/after measurements and an action summary.
- Keep the cleanup low risk by only removing old files and cache artifacts,
  while preserving user documents, downloads, and recent files.

Professional cleanup categories in this toolkit include:

- system temp folders
- Chrome cache and GPU/media cache
- DNS client cache
- Recycle Bin
- old print-spool files when explicitly requested

## Troubleshooting

When the user supplies `errores.txt`:

1. Read the complete file.
2. Identify the first terminating error and its script line.
3. Fix the root cause without suppressing unrelated failures.
4. Preserve detailed error output in `Ejecutar-Soporte.cmd`.
5. Parse the updated script with a PowerShell parser before delivery.

Account for Windows PowerShell 5.1 behavior, especially native stderr,
`$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`, generic lists, empty-array parameter
binding, COM objects, and cmdlet availability.

The final report must explain how to interpret each evidence block and must
distinguish `Normal`, `Revisar`, and `Crítico`. A single public IP, process,
event, service, DNS entry, or failed ping is not proof of malware or an
incident; correlate time, process, PID, service, IP, MAC, DNS, port, protocol,
firewall rule, and FortiGate/FortiNAC records before escalating.

To parse-check a script on Linux without root, download a portable
PowerShell build instead of guessing at syntax:

```bash
curl -sL -o /tmp/pwsh.tar.gz "https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.4.6/powershell-7.4.6-linux-x64.tar.gz"
mkdir -p /tmp/pwsh && tar -xzf /tmp/pwsh.tar.gz -C /tmp/pwsh
chmod +x /tmp/pwsh/pwsh
/tmp/pwsh/pwsh -NoProfile -Command '
  $tokens = $null; $errors = $null
  [void][System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile("scripts/Auditar-Trafico.ps1", [ref]$tokens, [ref]$errors)
  $errors | ForEach-Object { "Line $($_.Extent.StartLineNumber): $($_.Message)" }
'
```

Known PS 5.1 parser pitfalls seen in this toolkit:

- `"$var: texto"` inside a double-quoted string is read as a scope/drive
  reference (like `$env:`) and fails with "Missing type name after '['" or
  "Variable reference is not valid". Use `"${var}: texto"` instead.
- Avoid unqualified BCL type literals (e.g. `[ConsoleColor]`) as function
  parameter defaults; prefer `[string]` with a color name, since `Write-Host
  -ForegroundColor` accepts plain color-name strings.
- `raw.githubusercontent.com` is served through a CDN that can cache briefly;
  `curl` the raw URL to confirm the pushed fix is actually being served
  before assuming a caching issue.

## Distribution

For GitHub (`https://github.com/ldadev/mobley_support.git`), use the URLs documented in `references/github.txt` or prefer raw URLs:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldadev/mobley_support/main/PATH/FILE
```

PowerShell direct execution command from GitHub:

```powershell
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldadev/mobley_support/main/scripts/Ejecutar-Soporte-GitHub.ps1" | iex
```

Or share the compiled `Soporte-PC.exe` (built from `scripts/launcher.c`) for
users who prefer a double-clickable file over pasting a PowerShell command.
Expect Windows SmartScreen to warn on first run because the binary is
unsigned; the toolkit does not use a paid code-signing certificate.

Do not put credentials or private-repository tokens in scripts. When using a
short remote command, make it clear that `irm URL | iex` executes the retrieved
content in memory and is appropriate only for an explicitly trusted endpoint.

## Updating the toolkit

When changing any bundled operational file:

1. Keep the source and skill copies synchronized.
2. Preserve all four modes and report compatibility.
3. Validate PowerShell syntax.
4. Confirm that the direct download returns the expected file rather than an
   HTML login or confirmation page.
